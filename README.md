# Anivia

_Please note: This repository is currently just a place-holder._

Anivia is a system for running answer set programs and parsing answer sets with Clingo 4.

It consists of a wrapper around the Clingo Python API designed to ease the integration of ASP into your Python programs.
ASP is powerful, because it enables non-monotonic logical inference and defeasible reasoning capabilities
(including abductive and default reasoning) with very large and possibly incomplete knowledge bases.
It is particularly effective at solving problems with many complex interacting constraints.
